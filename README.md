# buy-bot
An automated python script that helps you buy an item from a shopping website.

The functionality of this script can be extended to buy but for now it only selects and item, adds it to the cart and sends an alert to the user via sms so the user can complete the final step.

This uses selenium webdriver and twilio.
For selenium webdriver you will need to adjust the xpath's in this script to match your desired the shopping website's url. This example uses Walmart's site.
